CUMBIA (Montejo and Kowalsky 2007) is a set of Matlab/Octave codes to perform monotonic moment-curvature analysis and force-displacement response of reinforced concrete (RC) members of rectangular or circular sections. This version of CUMBIA is following the CUMBIARECT code and is specifically adjusted for RC walls.
